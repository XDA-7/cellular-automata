# cellular-automata
A simple display of the rule 30 automaton described at length in Stephen Wolfram's book 'A New Kind of Science'

The automaton follows a simple set of rules for determining its layout, and automata with similar rules exhibit a simple, periodic structure. Yet rule 30 appears to do no such thing, instead exhibiting a structure chaotic and seemingly unpredictable for conventional forms of analysis used in science and mathematics.

Wolfram uses this basis to further conject that phenomena in the natural world which are difficult to measure and predict with techniques commonly used in science, may follow similarly simple rules and might be better understood through modelling as an automaton simulation.
